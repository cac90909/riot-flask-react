    "\n",
    "> This is the type of information stored in a single participant's frame. Notice how it is contained in a dictionary, so every parameter stored here can be used as a dictionary key.\n",

    "<img src=\"../reference images/frame_intervals_example.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note, when trying to access the different moments of a game, be aware of the fact that each game is different in length, so they will inherently have different quantities of frames. But also, the API data does not capture information at equidistant frame intervals. Probably need to use a \".keys()\" addition if you want to access a specific frame that is return from \"get_match_frames(x,y).\n",

    "> For reference, it is estimated that the size of the League of Legends map is about 16,000 'units'. I don't exactly know what that unit means, but I am going to use these parameters to set the bounardies for the matplot map. Additionally, I am operating under the assumption that the League of Legends map is a square.\n",

    "<img src=\"../reference images/timestamp_issue.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is probably a good idea to have a seperate handler/data organizer for the match's events. This is because your current data structure uses the timestamps as keys for the various states of the game. However, due to the nature of events, they do not happen syncronously at exact timestamp. Instead, each events kind of has a unique timestamp that pertains to that specific event.\n",

    "<img src=\"../reference images/data_struc_events.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note, this is the current setup for the 'events' side of your game data structure. Each event is accessed with its own key. The key is just sequential integers. Additionally, the events are stored in chronlogical order. I didn't use the timestamp as the key for each event simply due to the lack of uniformity in the timestamps and how they are randomly dispersed throughout the game.\n",

    "<img src=\"../reference images/champ_pics.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note, in order to actually retrieve the champion name, instead of just their ID, you have to use this JSON page. This is because the 'match detail' objects contain a key called 'participants'. Each participant has a unique 'championId' which is identical to the 'key' parameter from the JSON given on: http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/11.11.1/data/en_US/champion.jsonhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/11.11.1/data/en_US/champion.json. Simply looking up the key from this JSON link and connecting it to the championId allows us to display actual champion names instead of just ids. Additionally, we can use the name to connect to: http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/11.11.1/img/champion/Aatrox.png. Simply substitute the champion name in this link will give a small square image of each character. This important because on our minimap we want to display each person by their specific champion. At some point, I will use a Javascript library or something to circle off each image since, currently, they come in square format.\n",
